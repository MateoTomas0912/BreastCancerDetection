# Breast Cancer Detection with Random Forest

This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, for the accurate detection of breast cancer. The dataset used comprises features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses, providing valuable insights into cell nuclei characteristics.

## Introduction

The dataset's construction involved a meticulous process, including the selection of relevant features through an exhaustive search in a multidimensional space. Utilizing the Random Forest algorithm, this project seeks to develop a predictive model capable of distinguishing between malignant and benign breast masses with high precision and reliability.

## Results

After rigorous testing, the Random Forest model achieved an impressive 98% precision on the F1 Score for identifying malignant and benign breast masses based on the extracted features. This high precision rate underscores the potential of machine learning in enhancing early detection strategies for breast cancer, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.
